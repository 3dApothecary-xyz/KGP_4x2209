## The KGP_4x2209 is a complete, cost effective, easy to use 3D printer main controller board for beginners and experts

Designed for Klipper, the KGP_4x2209 is fast to set up and simple to wire into an existing 3D printer chassis or a new one.  The Raspberry Pi CM4, or equivalent, Single Board Computer (SBC) sockets provide a one-stop host connection between the main controller board and the host that includes the USB connection, power as well as commonly used Raspberry Pi peripherals including additional USB 2.0 sockets, Ethernet connection, HDMI output, CSI and DSI connectors as well as the standard 40 pin Raspberry Pi IO connector.  As a Klipper main contorller board, the KGP_4x2209 is well featured with all of the most used standard 3D printer peripherals as well a CAN port for implementing toolhead controllers.  The KGP_4x2209 is the best designed and most capable 3D printer main controller board available.  

The KGP_4x2209 was designed with an eye towards making its set up and operation as fast and intuitive as possible.  Connectors are color coded as well as being horizontal, giving clear access to the pin information on the PCB silkscreen as well as the many indicator LEDs.  Electrically, peripheral functions are designed to be "orthogonal" which means they are not set for predetermined functions - for example, the stepper motor drivers can be used for any of the axes or the extruder and the heater outputs are designed for bed heaters (not a single bed heater and extruder heater).  The KGP_4x2209 is designed for simplified power wiring with having the host built into the PCB and CAN power provided in the standard Microfit connector.  The positioning of connectors was done in mind of user needs, not the convenience of the board designer.  With mounting holes placed at the board corners, not interfering with connector, the KGP_4x2209 was designed by 3D printer enthusiasts for 3D printer enthusiasts to get the printers up and running as quicking and easily as possible.
