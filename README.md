### The KGP_4x2209 is a complete, cost effective, easy to use 3D printer main controller board for beginners and experts

Designed for Klipper, the KGP_4x2209 is fast to set up and simple to wire into an existing 3D printer chassis or a new one.  The Raspberry Pi CM4, or equivalent, Single Board Computer sockets provide a one-stop host connection between the main controller board and the host that includes the USB connection, power as well as commonly used Raspberry Pi peripherals including additional USB 2.0 sockets, Ethernet connection, HDMI output, DSI and CSI connectors as well as the standard 40 pin Raspberry Pi IO connector.  As a Klipper main contorller board, the KGP_4x2209 is well featured with all of the most used standard 3D printer peripherals as well a CAN port for implementing toolhead controllers.  Connectors on the KGP_4x2209 are color coded (white for output, yellow for sensors and red for heater inputs) as well as being horizontal, giving the user clear access to the pin information on the PCB silkscreen as well as the many indicator LEDs.  The KGP_4x2209 is the best designed and most capable 3D printer main controller board available.
